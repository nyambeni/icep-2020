“Add to Cart” – Means a call for actions to help in increasing the average items per order. Thus improving the share of wallet per order
“Add to Wishlist” – Reduces the shopping cart abandonment and improves overall funnel. Also creates an opportunity to know the users’ interest and strike a conversation.

Adding to wishlist doesn't affect the quantity of the product added, but adding in cart does.

Add to wishlist is more like day-dreaming about the product that you'd wish to buy.
