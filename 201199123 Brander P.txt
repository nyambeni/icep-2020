2ND WEEK
27 January 2020
-Cloned icep-2020
-created a branch
-pushed back to git
-brainstormed project ideas
I went to 10-g44,  to  give ideas of a new system to implement to Godi with my team members. We gave Godi some of our ideas and one was approved for commencement.  WE WERE BUILDING A SYSTEM IN A WEEK.

28 January 2020
-assigned task of creating Back-end register for Emergency System
-Researched on how to use Nodejs MySQL
I had a meeting with my team and we assigned tasks to each member. I was assigned to design a login page for our system COA.
I started with my research, basically to have knowledge in NodeJS and I was implementing the back end.
I had serious challenges since I wasn’t familiar with the new language.
28 January 2020
I was busy with more research, but there was progress because I saw the bits that I have implemented. My progress was moving slow but time was not on my sight because we ought to present on Friday 31st January.
I went to see the business analysts to get more clarity on the page (login) I was working on, because there was no stylings on their page, and I on the other side I had familiarized myself with NodeJS.
29 January 2020
-Research on NodeJS Express
-Linking NodeJS and Express API
I managed to create the login page, the only problem was the validation not working. I did some more research on validations for email and password and I managed to find some examples online. Studied more on API's and connecting to database.
By the time I knocked off, the login page was fully functioning.
30 January 2020
-Met with the scrum master Calvin 
-Added a list on what should be done on trello
-Learned to connect to the Database
I was trying to link/connect my login page with the other pages (registration, landing and admin page) my team created and it was one of the biggest challenges, as well as connecting to the front end.
I searched online for some few videos on how to do the connection, the problem was the videos were using node with mongodb and I was trying to do everything with PHP/MySQL, so the most of the things changed a lot to the recent version of NodeJS with Express, that’s the main reason I was struggling.
31 January 2020
-Added update and get APIs
-Checked the ERD with the BAs
I was doing the connection of the node app with MySQL. Finally I managed to. I was also introduced to authentication using JSON Web Tokens. Implementation was tested using POSTMAN.
3 February 2020
-Research on JWT and creating a service
I prepared for the presentation and in the meantime of waiting to go to present, we as a team managed to do the linking of the pages, we did some preview of our final product to the business analysts before we could present.
Presentation was postponed to the following day for other two teams.

4 February 2020
-presented system
I was presenting the system with my team, and of course it wasn’t functioning fully, but we implement minimal viable product, as long as the other functional requirements were functioning.
5 February 2020
-Got introduced to my new team for the ICEP Website
-Researched similar Websites
I went to the business analysts lab to get new project. I was grouped with my new team and we were given a new system, basically to revamp the ICEP website and add a new functional requirements that will sort of include 3 tie system.
I was brainstorming with my team on what to do with the system, like adding more other functionalities, like adverts, application form for interviews, and live chatting.
I was assigned a task of developing  a registration form, now on the front end.
6 February 2020
-Starded with the register API
-Researched on new ideas 
I was learning bootstrap, and I managed to create a registration page with some new interface, yet with no validation.
Teams were called for scrum session.

7 February 2020
I did some validations for the front end on the application form.
