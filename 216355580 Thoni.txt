27 January 2020 – 7 February 2020 Report


27 January 2020:
* Groups were formed between developers and business analysts to come up with a system to complete for the next 5 days.
* We were combined with BA’s to brainstorm ideas. We ended up choosing a system called “Lost and Found” which could be used to retrieve lost items by uploading a picture of the item you found then describing it in a description form. The person who has lost an item can log their lost item in order to see if it might be on the database of lost items. 
* During the day I was learning the basic commands of gitbash and working with github, also about mongodb.
* Later on we presented the idea to our respective icep supervisors.
28 January 2020:
* Tasks were assigned on Trello by BA’s.
* As developers we choose the activities to be completed in order to develop a full system.
* I was doing the backend of the login page.
* Started researching about node.js, mongodb, basically MEAN.
29 January 2020
* Was working on activating the database connection of the login page using node and express.
* Throughout the day it was basically me researching the backend activation.

* Went to register for IDC30BT.
30 January 2020
* Created the database data using xampp and myphpadmn.
* Connected the backend login page to the login page that was created by Lethu, which was quite a challenge we had to work together trying to figure out the code in angular used to connect the database.
31 January 2020
On this day it mostly us finalizing every task that was needed to be completed. We meet with the BA’s to discuss further more the implications we had with their documentation. Tensions were high I wont lie cause of miscommunication. We called it a day very early cause there was technical implications.
